# Quantum Waddle

A tutorial on 1D and 2D quantum walks using Qiskit, with real quantum hardware.

## How to run

Run the python notebooks in the submissions folder:

- The [tutorial notebook](Tutorial.ipynb) helps you gain intuition for a quantum walk on a discrete quantum circuit
- The 1D and 2D quantum walk notebooks compare classical random walks, a simulated quantum walk and a quantum walk on IBM hardware.
