# Quantum Waddle

A tutorial on 1D and 2D quantum walks using Qiskit, with real quantum hardware. 
Made during the 2020 iQuHACK hackathon at MIT.

## How to run

Install the requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt --user`

Run the python notebooks in the submissions folder:

- The [tutorial notebook](Tutorial.ipynb) helps you gain intuition for a quantum walk using a quantum circuit.
- The [1D quantum walk](1D%20walk%20on%20IBM.ipynb) and [2D quantum walk](2D%20walk%20on%20IBM.ipynb) notebooks compare classical random walks, a simulated quantum walk and a quantum walk on IBM hardware.
